Recipe Provider Android Application Prototype
==========

How to get the code?
-----------
You can clone the repository or download it as a zip file. You should then have a file called recipe. We have used android studio for this application prototype and so you will also need to have android studio installed on your computer to be able to use the application. 

How to run the code?
-----------
You have two choices for running the application. You can either use an emulator, or if you have an android device, you can run the application on it.  
The application will run faster and smoother on an android device than on an emulator.

Run on android device:  
* Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable.
* Enable USB debugging on your device by going to Settings > Developer options.  
Note: On Android 4.2 and newer, Developer options is hidden by default. To make it visible go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times. Return to the previous screen and you will find Developer options.
* In Android Studio, click the app module in the Project window and then select Run > Run or click Run button in the tool bar(a button with a green rectangle).
* In the select deployment area, choose your device, and press ok.  

Run on emulator:
* Click Run button in the tool bar and you will be asked to choose a virtual device. If you don’t have one set up, you will need to create one.  
* In the select deployment, select the “Create New Virtual Device” button.  
* In category select phone,choose the Nexus 5, and press next.  
* Choose the x86 image button and select Jelly Bean, with API Level 16 and press next. (you may need to download it).
* Press finish.  
* You should now see the virtual device you just created in the select deployment area.  
* Select it and press ok.  
The emulator may take a couple of minutes to start when first running the app. If the app is slow or laggy, it is due to the emulator and debugger running.
