Recipe Provider Android Application Prototype
==========

How to get the code?
-----------
You can clone the repository or download it as a zip file. You should then have a file called recipe. We have used android studio for this application prototype and so you will also need to have android studio installed on your computer to be able to use the application. 

How to run the code?
-----------
You have two choices on how to run the application. You can either use an emulator, or if you have an android device, you can run the application on it.  
The application will run faster and smoother on an android device than on an emulator.

Run on android device:
*Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable.
*Enable USB debugging on your device by going to Settings > Developer options.
Note: On Android 4.2 and newer, Developer options is hidden by default. To make it visible go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times. Return to the previous screen to find Developer options.
